## **Project: E-Commerce Application Deployment & CI/CD Automation**

**Domain:** E-Commerce (Order & Inventory Management)
**Duration:** June 2022 – Present
**Role:** DevOps Engineer

---

### **Project Overview**

I worked on deploying and maintaining a **Java-based 3-tier e-commerce application** (frontend UI, backend REST API, and MySQL database) in a **production-grade AWS environment**.

Our team followed **Agile methodology**:

* **Jira** for sprint planning, bug tracking, and user stories
* **Confluence** for maintaining deployment runbooks, troubleshooting guides, and architecture diagrams
* **Slack** for daily stand-ups, incident notifications, and deployment coordination
* **Github** for code hosting and pull request reviews

The project required setting up a **fully automated CI/CD pipeline**, implementing **code quality gates**, managing **artifacts**, ensuring **security best practices**, and using **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** for scalable deployments across staging and production.

---

### **Infrastructure Architecture**

#### **AWS Components**

* **EKS Cluster** (Staging & Production) – Application deployments using Kubernetes workloads
* **EC2 (t3.medium)** – Hosting Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus Repository Manager
* **ALB (Application Load Balancer)** – Routing traffic to EKS services based on paths
* **RDS MySQL (Multi-AZ)** – Highly available database with automated backups and point-in-time recovery
* **ECR (Elastic Container Registry)** – Private Docker image storage
* **S3 Buckets** – Static file storage, build logs, and backup storage
* **CloudWatch & Grafana** – Metrics, logs, and dashboard visualizations
* **Secrets Manager** – Secure storage of DB credentials, API keys, and tokens
* **Custom VPC** – Private subnets for RDS & EKS nodes, public subnets for ALB

---

### **Security Best Practices Applied**

* RDS deployed in **private subnet** to restrict public access
* Security Groups & NACLs allowing **only required ports** (HTTPS 443, MySQL 3306 internal only)
* S3 buckets encrypted with **AES-256** and restricted with **IAM policies**
* IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) — ensuring **least privilege access** for Kubernetes pods
* CI/CD agents using **temporary AWS STS tokens** instead of long-lived credentials

---

### **CI/CD Pipeline Design**

We implemented **separate pipelines** for **frontend** and **backend** services to enable parallel deployments.

**Core Tools Integrated:**

* **Jenkins** – Pipeline orchestration

  * Plugins used: `Pipeline`, `Git Parameter`, `SonarQube Scanner`, `Kubernetes CLI`, `Email-ext`, `Blue Ocean`
* **SonarQube** – Code quality & vulnerability scans
* **Nexus Repository Manager** – Storing versioned artifacts
* **Docker** – Image packaging
* **AWS CLI & kubectl** – Automated Kubernetes deployments

---

#### **Backend (Java Spring Boot) Pipeline Flow**

1. **Trigger:** Git push to `develop` branch triggers Jenkins pipeline
2. **Build:** Maven build → `.jar` generated
3. **Static Code Analysis:** SonarQube scan (quality gate enforcement, OWASP dependency check)
4. **Artifact Upload:** `.jar` uploaded to Nexus
5. **Docker Image Build:** Versioned image → pushed to AWS ECR
6. **Staging Deployment:**

   * Update Helm values with new image tag
   * Deploy to EKS staging namespace (`kubectl apply`)
7. **Smoke Tests:** API health check & functional tests via Postman CLI
8. **Manual Approval:** Jenkins input step before production release
9. **Production Deployment:** **Rolling update** in EKS for zero downtime

---

#### **Frontend Pipeline Flow**

1. **Trigger:** Git push to `develop` branch
2. **Build:** Node.js build → static files generated
3. **Code Scan:** SonarQube JavaScript analysis
4. **Docker Build & Push:** Image pushed to AWS ECR
5. **Deploy:** Update EKS frontend service
6. **CloudFront Invalidation** (if CDN enabled) to refresh cache

---

### **Branching Strategy (Git Flow)**

* `develop` – Active development branch
* `feature/*` – Feature-specific branches
* `release/*` – Pre-production testing branch
* `hotfix/*` – Urgent production fixes
* `main` – Production-ready code

---

### **Monitoring & Alerts**

#### **CloudWatch Metrics:**

* EKS: Pod restarts, CPU/memory usage, deployment events
* RDS: CPU utilization, active connections, replication lag
* ALB: Request count, 4xx/5xx errors, target response times

#### **Grafana Dashboards:**

* Integrated CloudWatch metrics & application logs for visual insights

#### **Alerting:**

* AWS SNS → Slack channel integration for real-time incident alerts
* PagerDuty integration for high-severity alerts during on-call rotation

---

### **Day-to-Day Responsibilities**

* Managing Jenkins pipelines (bug fixes, optimizations, plugin updates)
* Updating Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests for new releases
* Monitoring production workloads & responding to CloudWatch/Grafana alerts
* Performing Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for failed deployments
* Optimizing AWS costs (node autoscaling, EC2 right-sizing, RDS performance tuning)
* Onboarding developers & setting IAM access
* Maintaining runbooks & playbooks in Confluence

---

### **Common Production Issues & Resolutions**

| Issue                                                    | Resolution                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Jenkins pipeline failed due to ECR authentication errors | Rotated IAM keys, updated Jenkins credentials, and enabled AWS CLI v2 login |
| Slow RDS queries during peak hours                       | Added DB indexes, scaled to larger instance, enabled query caching          |
| EKS pod CrashLoopBackOff                                 | Checked container logs → fixed missing env variable in ConfigMap            |
| ALB health check failures                                | Adjusted readiness/liveness probes in deployment YAML                       |
| SonarQube quality gate failed                            | Worked with developers to refactor code & remove critical vulnerabilities   |

# SCRIPT to tell in interview



We built and maintained a Java-based three-tier e-commerce platform — frontend, backend API, and a MySQL database — fully deployed on AWS with production-grade practices. This was a multi-team project involving developers, testers, and operations, and I was responsible for CI/CD, infrastructure automation, and production monitoring.

The architecture was security-focused. We had a custom VPC with public and private subnets: EKS worker nodes and RDS in private subnets, accessible only through a bastion host. Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus ran on hardened EC2 instances in the public subnet with restricted IAM roles. S3 stored static assets, CloudFront handled content delivery, and ECR stored our Docker images. CloudWatch collected logs and metrics, and Grafana dashboards provided real-time visibility.

Our CI/CD pipelines were fully automated. For the backend, Jenkins pulled code from GitHub, ran Maven builds, scanned code with SonarQube, stored artifacts in Nexus, built Docker images, pushed them to ECR, and deployed to staging via kubectl. Smoke tests ran automatically, and production deployments followed manual approval, using rolling updates or blue-green strategies for zero downtime. The frontend pipeline included an additional CloudFront cache invalidation step post-deployment.

We encountered real-world challenges. Once, a ConfigMap change caused EKS pods to enter CrashLoopBackOff — we resolved it within minutes by rolling back using versioned YAMLs in Git. Another time, SonarQube blocked a release due to critical vulnerabilities, requiring close coordination with developers to fix dependencies. IAM role misconfigurations also caused ECR push failures, which we solved by refining policies and adding re-authentication scripts.

Infrastructure provisioning was automated using Terraform with reusable modules for EKS, RDS, ALB, and networking. We integrated OWASP dependency scans and Checkov IaC scans into the pipeline, catching vulnerabilities and misconfigurations before production.

As a result, deployment times dropped by over 60%, we achieved near-zero downtime releases, and critical alerts were integrated with Slack for instant team response. This setup gave us a resilient, secure, and highly automated environment that scaled smoothly while maintaining high availability.

## **1️⃣ Architecture & Design**

**Q:** Walk me through your project’s architecture. Why did you design it this way?
**They’re testing:** Whether you actually understand the moving parts, dependencies, and trade-offs.
**Answer structure:**

* **Start high-level:** “It’s a three-tier Java e-commerce platform: Angular frontend, Spring Boot backend, MySQL DB.”
* **Cloud design:** Custom VPC → public subnets (bastion, ALB, Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube) → private subnets (EKS worker nodes, RDS).
* **Security reason:** Private subnets to isolate DB & app nodes from direct internet exposure; bastion for secure SSH.
* **HA features:** Multi-AZ RDS, ALB across AZs, EKS node autoscaling.

---

## **2️⃣ CI/CD**

**Q:** Can you explain your Jenkins pipeline stages for the backend?
**They’re testing:** Your ability to recall real stages and justify them.
**Answer structure:**

1. **Code checkout** from GitHub.
2. **Maven build** for Java packaging.
3. **SonarQube scan** → quality gate enforcement.
4. **Artifact upload** to Nexus.
5. **Docker build & tag**.
6. **Push to ECR**.
7. **Deploy to EKS (staging)** via kubectl.
8. **Automated smoke tests**.
9. **Manual approval gate**.
10. **Production deploy** (rolling update / blue-green).

---

## **3️⃣ AWS**

**Q:** Why did you use a bastion host instead of connecting directly to private instances?
**They’re testing:** Security best practices knowledge.
**Answer structure:**

* Direct SSH to private subnet is impossible without exposing it to the internet.
* Bastion (jump host) has controlled inbound rules and IAM-restricted access.
* All SSH activity is logged for audit purposes.

---

## **4️⃣ Kubernetes (EKS)**

**Q:** How did you handle application rollbacks in EKS?
**They’re testing:** If you know real rollback methods in production.
**Answer structure:**

* Versioned Kubernetes manifests in Git.
* `kubectl rollout undo deployment/<name>` for quick rollback.
* Helm charts with version numbers for reproducible deploys.
* Example: ConfigMap change broke pods → reverted manifest from Git & redeployed.

---

## **5️⃣ Monitoring & Logging**

**Q:** How did you detect production issues?
**They’re testing:** If you know end-to-end observability practices.
**Answer structure:**

* **Metrics:** CloudWatch for CPU/memory, Grafana dashboards for custom app metrics.
* **Logs:** CloudWatch log groups for EKS pods, ALB access logs in S3.
* **Alerts:** CloudWatch alarms → SNS → Slack integration for instant notifications.

---

## **6️⃣ Security**

**Q:** How did you ensure security in CI/CD pipelines?
**They’re testing:** Security integration awareness.
**Answer structure:**

* **Code scans:** SonarQube for code quality/security issues.
* **Dependency scans:** OWASP Dependency-Check in Jenkins.
* **IaC scans:** Checkov for Terraform scripts.
* **IAM least privilege:** Separate roles for Jenkins, EKS, and developers.
* **ECR vulnerability scan** before deployment.

---

## **7️⃣ Troubleshooting / Incident Handling**

**Q:** Tell me about a production issue you solved.
**They’re testing:** Incident resolution skills.
**Example Answer:**

* **Incident:** EKS pods in CrashLoopBackOff after ConfigMap update.
* **Detection:** Grafana alert + `kubectl describe pod` showed config parsing error.
* **Resolution:** Rolled back ConfigMap from Git, redeployed, verified health.
* **Prevention:** Added staging validation pipeline for ConfigMaps.
